# Five Nights at F***boy's: Final Mix Archipelago Randomizer
 This is a mod for Five Night's at F***boy's that targets the Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer.
 The apworld code is heavily based on [Phar's work for Rogue Legacy](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/tree/main/worlds/rogue_legacy), as I'm new to coding and am still somewhat trying to make sense of this stuff personally.
 The game mod itself will be using the [archipelago-rb](https://github.com/EggonHub/archipelago-rb) project to communicate with AP.
